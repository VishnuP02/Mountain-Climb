# Mountain Climb Simulation

## Project Description
The **Mountain Climb Simulation** is a C++ program that simulates a hiker climbing a mountain. Each day, the hiker climbs a random number of meters (between 100 and 300), and the program outputs the hikerâ€™s progress day-by-day until they reach the summit of 3,000 meters.

## Features
- **Randomized Climb Simulation**: Generates a random number of meters climbed each day.
- **Day-by-Day Output**: Displays each day's progress, including the meters climbed and total height achieved.
- **Completion Notification**: Notifies when the hiker reaches the summit, showing the number of days taken.
